XIVLauncher (link) comes bundled with Dalamud, a system that hooks\n        into game functions on-the-fly to read, act on, enhance, and even completely replace elements and functionality\n        entirely. Simple things like calculating critical hit percent chance from your Crit stat to display on your\n        character sheet all the way to outright fully automated gameplay.\n\n        The Dalamud team has a list of prepackaged and reviewed sets of these plugins that meet specific criteria, like\n        not sending invalid data to the servers or performing detectable automation. Outside of this realm is where\n        Mare Synchronos comes in.\n\n        Custom Repo Plugins don't fall under the review purview of the Dalamud team, so people are free to develop plugins\n        however they like to do whatever they want. A subsection of these plugins revolve around modding, or doing\n        things like texture and model replacements, enhancing the functionality of the /gpose (screenshot tools) functions,\n        etc.. Penumbra/Glamourer, the two cornerstone plugins that handle on-the-fly texture and model editting/swaps, are\n        probably the most used plugins in the ecosystem _period_... people just want their catgirls to look pretty.\n\n        However, modding plugins (and most other plugins) by their nature are client side only - if it's not sending any data\n        to the server then no one else but you can see them. (Link to the YoshiP blog?) This is where Mare Synchronos comes in.\n\n        MareSync hooked into Penumbra/Glamourer in order to transmit the appearance data of your modded character, transfer the\n        files through a management server hosted by the developer, and send them to another person to be rendered live. This\n        massively changed the modding ecosystem of FFXIV forever and what was joking \"a niche of a niche plugin\" became hundreds\n        of thousands of users over its three-year lifespan. At one point near the end of its lifespan it had transferred\n        Petabytes (PLURAL) of data a month. How Cloudflare didn't freak out about it we'll never know...\n\n        Due to some back and forth with the developer I was tagged as a 'wannabe dev' in their Discord server, which gave me\n        access to see behind the curtain a little. I was already hyper-connected to a lot of info streams but it opened my eyes\n        to a lot about the community as a whole - for better and most definitely for worse. Darkarchon is pretty damn\n        knowledgeable and he held together a lot of the community whether they realized it or not.\n    \u003C/p>\n\u003C/details>\n## Day 0\nWhich made the day he informed everyone he would be shutting down the service a shock to literally everyone.\n\n## Day 7\nSo I started building things...","src/content/blog/01-maresync-saga/index.mdx","f1972e3cab47dce3"]
