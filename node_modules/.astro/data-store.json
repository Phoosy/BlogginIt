XIVLauncher (link) comes bundled with Dalamud, a system that hooks\n        into game functions on-the-fly to read, act on, enhance, and even completely replace elements and functionality\n        entirely. Simple things like calculating critical hit percent chance from your Crit stat to display on your\n        character sheet all the way to outright fully automated gameplay.\n\n        The Dalamud team has a list of prepackaged and reviewed sets of these plugins that meet specific criteria, like\n        not sending invalid data to the servers or performing detectable automation. Outside of this realm is a thriving\n        community of plugins (referred to as 'custom repo plugins') that cover a wide variety of things outside of some\n        of the Dalamud official repo suite. \n\n        Custom repo plugins don't fall under the review purview of the Dalamud team, so people are free to develop plugins\n        however they like to do whatever they want. A subsection of these plugins revolve around modding, or doing\n        things like texture and model replacements, enhancing the functionality of the /gpose (screenshot tools) functions,\n        etc.. Penumbra/Glamourer, the two cornerstone plugins that handle on-the-fly texture and model editting/swaps, are\n        probably the most used plugins in the ecosystem _period_... people just want their catgirls to look pretty.\n\n        However, modding plugins (and most other plugins) by their nature are client side only - if it's not sending any data\n        to the server then no one else but you can see them. [YoshiP, the Director and Producer of the game, wrote a\n        blog post](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/9e5517bca992ff35133f519db15eb456d2183251)\n        that is very useful to help understand why the company might have issues with mods/plugins in general, but\n        more specifically anything that goes beyond just client side changes.\n        \n        This is where Mare Synchronos comes in.\n\n        MareSync hooked into Penumbra/Glamourer in order to transmit the appearance data of your modded character, transfer the\n        files through a management server hosted by the developer, and send them to another person to be rendered live. This\n        massively changed the modding ecosystem of FFXIV forever and what was joking \"a niche of a niche plugin\" became hundreds\n        of thousands of users over its three-year lifespan. At one point near the end of its lifespan it had transferred\n        Petabytes (PLURAL) of data a month. How Cloudflare didn't freak out about it we'll never know...\n\n        Due to some back and forth with the developer I was tagged as a 'wannabe dev' in their Discord server, which gave me\n        access to see behind the curtain a little. I was already hyper-connected to a lot of info streams but it opened my eyes\n        to a lot about the community as a whole - for better and most definitely for worse. Darkarchon is pretty damn\n        knowledgeable and he held together a lot of the community whether the community realized it or not.\n    \u003C/p>\n\u003C/details>\n## Day 0\nThe day this post went out was a big shocker for the community as a whole.\n![The shutdown announcement from Darkarchon in the MareSync Discord](MareSyncShutdownAnnouncement.png)\n\nThose of us marked as wannabe devs in the MareSync Discord had some advance knowledge on it, as the process of verifying/consulting with legal\nwas done ahead of any public posts (not that it stopped someone leaking it from a closed dev chat in the Dalamud\ndiscord). I'll probably do an aside about some of the really weird and honestly alarming things I saw come out of\nthe community and Internet at large as a result of this announcement. It was very eye-opening.\n\nNeedless to say the situation sucked for the XIV community at-large. People had gotten used to a level of comfort with\nthese plugins that was always unsustainable. It's all built on hopes and dreams that Square Enix wouldn't flip the\nentirety of Dalamud on its head one day. They still could, to be clear, and even as I type this I see posts about \nprojects doubling down on the very things the director and producer YoshiP took issue with about these plugins.\n\nIn the wake of the shutdown people scrambled to try to replace the functionality. Whole communities were built up around\nsyncing mods for coordinated events (venues, roleplaying, 'nightclubs' or whatever you want to call them). Thus, the\nsync wars had begun...\n\n## Day 7\nIt didn't take long for replacements to prop up and tribalism to begin, but I didn't really care to try to integrate\nmyself into any of them. I noticed my wife and her Free Company didn't, either, and it got me thinking...\n\nWhat if I built a private version of the plugin? Darkarchon had made the source code available with some simple\ninstructions on how to do it, so why couldn't I follow them? Surely it's not that hard, right? (The original source\ncode is no longer available but many backups were floating around, including other sync services building on top of it)\n\nSpoiler: it was more difficult than even the devs I followed to a new group like a leech implied it was. For me, at\nleast. I'm not a programmer by any means, but I know how to read and apply code, interpret what I'm seeing and follow\nalong due to my background in scripting and general domain administration. So with a lot of help from a few of them\nand a ton of research along the way I set out to make my own private instance for my wife and her friends.\n\n## Lets get technical\nMare Synchronos is built in .NET upon the existing framework provided by Dalamud. Right out of the box as long as the\nplugin had a server to respond back to queries the plugin itself would work without issue once loaded into XIV.\n\n(Note for later: probably link to or write up a blog about wtf Dalamud et al. even is from my PoV as an unskilled\nprogrammer and wannabe developer)\n\u003CCallout type=\"warning\">\n    For obvious reasons I am not including screenshots of any of this working in game but I will post code snippets as\n    relevant.\n\u003C/Callout>\nSo the more complicated part for me was going to be building the server side of things. Thankfully darkarchon left\nsome useful instructions on setting up the services utilizing [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). Unfortunately they were \nwoefully out of date and also meant that I had to finally learn how Docker even worked. I've used Linux in server\nenvironments for work (I learned a lot screwing up QRadar installs on bare metal) and for running random game servers\nover the years but nothing for sustained, 'public' access that had very niche support paths. \n\nThanks to two very lovely people whom I will not name for now I did a lot of fumbling through setting up docker and\nnginx as a reverse proxy just to get services up and running.\n\n### Screwup One: Trying to Make Cloudflare Work\nSo Darkarchon utilized Cloudflare in order to better protect his service from regular DDoSing and try to improve overall\naccess. While it was just a small part of the latter, the former is where it really came in handy due to \n[their consistent ability to block them](https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/cloudflare-mitigates-yet-another-record-breaking-ddos-attack-which-at-22-2-tbps-is-nearly-twice-as-big-as-the-last-hyper-volumetric-attack/).\nIf it worked for him, it should work for me, right?\n\nWell maybe if I hadn't already screwed up configuring nginx's configuration at this stage it would have worked, but I\nalso had to accept that integrating Cloudflare into my setup was likely overkill considering my use case. Speaking of\nwhich...\n\n### What is my use case?\nAs of now, the most amount of people who have connected to my private instance is about 11 people all at once, and that's\nwith growth from the FC completely unrelated to me entirely. The people using it don't (generally) want to sync to large\nsyncshells full of hundreds of people are attend big parties. If they want to do that there are other sync plugins that\ncan provide for them, so for our purposes it just needs to work with this FC and be smooth enough to not be troublesome.\nActually very manageable.\n\n### Screwup Two: Docker Compose Files\nThis is a two-parter screw up: not really knowing how docker compose files worked and working off of older documentation on\na system I didn't understand. Here's a slice from the docker readme:\n\n```md\nFurthermore there are two environment variables `DEV_MARE_CDNURL` and `DEV_MARE_DISCORDTOKEN` which you are required to set.  \n`DEV_MARE_CDNURL` should point to `http://\u003Cyourip or dyndns>:6200/cache/` and `DEV_MARE_DISCORDTOKEN` is an oauth token from a bot you need to create through the Discord bot portal.\nYou should also set `DEV_MARE_CDNURL2` to `http://\u003Cyourip or dyndns>:6201/cache/`\nIt is enough to set them as User variables. The compose files refer to those environment variables to overwrite configuration settings for the Server and Services to set those respective values.  \nIt is also possible to set those values in the configuration.json files themselves.  \nWithout a valid Discord bot you will not be able to register accounts without fumbling around in the PostgreSQL database.\n\n## 3. Run Mare Server\nThe run folder contains two major Mare configurations which is `standalone` and `sharded`.  \nBoth configurations default to port `6000` for the main server connection and `6200` for the files downloads. Sharded configuration additionally uses `6201` for downloads. No HTTPS.  \nAll `appsettings.json` configurations provided are extensive at the point of writing, note the differences between the shard configurations and the main servers respectively.  \nThey can be used as examples if you want to spin up your own servers otherwise.\n```\nIn retrospect there are some elements that aren't obvious to someone not versed in the ecosystem or development in\ngeneral, but I'm a special kind of dumb. Here's a small list of my first missteps:\n- Didn't even know how to set up an .env file or use them, so I just hardcoded everything\n- Editing the wrong fields in the jsons that used generic service URLs that were meant to remain as-is\n- Filling in one field that was only modified if you were using the sharded version of the service (I was not)\n- Blindly swapping out names for the sake of branding without knowing what it might impact\n- Relying on Gemini to try to pick out some of the error messages I was getting (turns out if it doesn't have full access\nto context then neither will you!)\n\nBut that's just the start. I hadn't messed with nginx before so I also needed to learn how it, and reverse proxies,\nactually worked and what would be a secure setup that allowed the plugin to talk to the server. One thing I did pick up\nquickly on was setting up the Docker compose file to not expose every service port to the Internet blindly. Yes, I know\neveryone and their mother can easily find out what the configuration is just by referencing the same codebase as I was\nbut better to prevent inquiries than invite them openly.\n\n### Screwup Three: Nginx Configuration\nWith a lot of help from another fellow wannabe dev I managed to get a working config, but not without some growing pains.\nThis screwup was pretty brief because a lot of my tinkering with nginx had nothing to do with Nginx itself, but the fact\nI was troubleshooting multiple aspects at the same time with not a lot of understanding of how it was fitting together\nmeant I was adjusting things I didn't need to. The lesson here was to explicitly not do this, but that's obvious in\nhindsight, isn't it?\n\nOne of the big hangups was getting the Discord OAuth to work properly. Rather than manage secret keys with the service \nafter registering, Discord OAuth made it painless for people on the original service to reauthenticate and move on with\ntheir lives. If I wasn't trying to troubleshoot nginx, the plugin, and oauth at the same time I would have had it working\nway faster than the like two weeks it took me to get around to it.\n\n### An abrupt stop for now\nI decided to cut this blog post short, as I'll get into further detailing of how to configure the base sync client in\na new post. It's sort of out of date now given the state of the syncing plugin community now, but maybe it'll be useful\nto someone.","src/content/blog/maresync-saga/index.mdx","4ecc51e7b8974790",true,"first-entry",{"id":26,"data":28,"body":32,"filePath":33,"digest":34,"deferredRender":25},{"title":29,"description":30,"date":31},"First Astro Micro Blog Post","A devious first blog",["Date","2025-09-01T00:00:00.000Z"],"import Callout from \"@/components/Callout.astro\";\n\n---\n\n## Straight up bloggin it\nI'll eventually get rid of this page or something, I just want to see it work so my brain can associate action with result/reward.\nTypical atypical neurodivergent me\n\n\nI'm using this page as a template for all future pages just so I don't get lost later.

I'm going to be posting a lot about CachyOS, believe me.\n\u003C/Callout>\n\n## As usual, ADHD-lack-of-self-control kicks in..\nSo I sort of got hyped up about CachyOS from watching a YouTube video...\n\nNext thing I knew I was finishing up backups to my NAS and fully wiping my boot drive on my main computer.\n\nI chose CachyOS primarily from a shoutout by Level1Techs in [this Gamersnexus YT Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O6tQYJSEMw),\nwhich in particular shouted to me as the sort of thing I was interested in if I wanted to fully go all-in on Linux. I like\nthe idea of being able to tinker and FAFO but still have some level of stability for the games that I play without being\ncompletely on my own.\n\nSave for some stumbling in figuring out how the fuck Steam compatibility on Linux _actually_ worked I've had a pretty seamless\nexperience overall, which surprised me a lot. The fact I have a tech background meant I've obviously overlooked some\nweirdness that someone completely fresh-faced to this would have trouble but this is so much further along than I would\nhave expected. For reference, here's a quick hardware breakdown\n - ASRock B650E Taichi \n - Ryzen 7800X3D\n - 2x16GB Corsair Vengeance @ 6000Mhz\n - Seasonic Vertex GX-1000 PSU\n - 2x WD Black SN850X NVME drives\n - ASUS RTX 4080 Super ProArt \n - CPU under a dual rad watercooling loop (used to include GPU in old build)\n - PCIe USB hub (adding support for LianLi case front USB)\n - Corsair Commander XT hub\n\nAnd everything besides the Corsair Commander worked right out of the box without any additional tinkering at all. The\nCommander required me to grab [the OpenLinkHub packages](https://github.com/jurkovic-nikola/OpenLinkHub) and reconfigure\nmy fan/pump curves because the on-board data for some reason isn't properly reading; my pump would crank up to audible (for me)\nwithout much load and would stay that way even as temps dropped back down below thresholds.\n\n## Steam and Compatibility Options\nI play with an OLED monitor with HDR so I greatly value having those features even in this environment. Out of the box when\nI launched either Helldivers 2 or Dying Light: The Beast I noticed all my shit was ultra washed out and I didn't even have\nthe option to mess with HDR. [ProtonDB](https://www.protondb.com/) is supposed to be the salve for making this work but\nthat ended up being woefully unhelpful for two reasons: a lot of people run AMD GPUs in Linux and very few people actually contribute\nback information that's useful. A lot of the posts are people copy/pasting configs from elsewhere and just shrugging when it works\nwithout understanding why or how it does.\n\nI did manage to get HDR to be enabled and my games are running incredibly smoothly with next to no configuring on my part, but \nI did have to do a lot of research into what all the possible launch switches were, what they did, and why I might use them.\nI expect as I dig into other games in my library I will expand that expectation further, but time will tell.\n\n## Wayland? X11? GNOME?\nWhat I didn't expect was weird quirks I'd be sort of locked into based on what DE I chose. I went with KDE Plasma and it turns out\nstuff as simple as the wallet store being strangely behind in features and usability was just something everyone accepts\nor replaces. I'm still not even sure if I'm going to stick with it or try to move to something else but I thought I'd mention\nit. Plasma DE customization is very strange, as I quickly discovered even themes are hilariously fraught with missteps on trying to \nmake the work right. For example: \n - I found a theme I liked on (store.kde.org), but it turns out the instructions for installing it and a recommended\npackage to go with it are _several years_ out of date and both aren't even developed anymore. The link used on the theme page for [Lightly](https://github.com/Mrcuve0/Aritim-Dark)\nwasn't even the official repo which is archived, but thankfully I discovered [Darkly](https://github.com/Bali10050/Darkly)\nwhich is actively developed as a replacement.\n - Discord text rendering is very weird without setting launch options. Even after adding some launch args text still looks very strange\non my other monitor and I'm not entirely sure what the fix is yet.\n - Middle-click being paste absolutely DRIVES ME UP THE WALL because the setting to toggle it off doesn't actually even \ntoggle it off fully - THERE'S A SECOND OPTION YOU HAVE TO DISABLE TO ACTUALLY FULLY REMOVE THE FUNCTIONALITY. On top of\nthat Electron apps just straight up ignore the setting and need their own launch arg OR another package install to run\nand block it from pasting all the time.\n\n## Kernel/Nvidia Driver Updates Causing Crashes\nA recent change I dealt with this weekend revolves around some kind of update going through that utterly stumped me. A post on \nNvidia's forums, however, highlighted what the issue might be by someone experimenting and I'm baffled.\n\nI returned to Dying Light: The Beast after a couple days of fucking around and noticed when I started getting into combat with\na particular Volatile 'boss' I'd crash about 5-15 seconds in. This volatile would cause a lot of smoke effects, jump around,\nmake noise to attract other volatiles and was a pretty cool fight, but I couldn't figure out wtf had changed to cause this.\nTrying to vibe-troubleshoot didn't get me very far, but [this post on the Nvidia forums](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/580-release-feedback-discussion/341205/521)\npointed out that limiting framerates to 60 or below seemed to fix their crashing.\n\nHey, look at that: setting my frame limiter in the game settings to 60 from 144 stopped the crashing entirely.
