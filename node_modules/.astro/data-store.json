XIVLauncher (link) comes bundled with Dalamud, a system that hooks\n        into game functions on-the-fly to read, act on, enhance, and even completely replace elements and functionality\n        entirely. Simple things like calculating critical hit percent chance from your Crit stat to display on your\n        character sheet all the way to outright fully automated gameplay.\n\n        The Dalamud team has a list of prepackaged and reviewed sets of these plugins that meet specific criteria, like\n        not sending invalid data to the servers or performing detectable automation. Outside of this realm is where\n        Mare Synchronos comes in.\n\n        Custom Repo Plugins don't fall under the review purview of the Dalamud team, so people are free to develop plugins\n        however they like to do whatever they want. A subsection of these plugins revolve around modding, or doing\n        things like texture and model replacements, enhancing the functionality of the /gpose (screenshot tools) functions,\n        etc.. Penumbra/Glamourer, the two cornerstone plugins that handle on-the-fly texture and model editting/swaps, are\n        probably the most used plugins in the ecosystem _period_... people just want their catgirls to look pretty.\n\n        However, modding plugins (and most other plugins) by their nature are client side only - if it's not sending any data\n        to the server then no one else but you can see them. (Link to the YoshiP blog?) This is where Mare Synchronos comes in.\n\n        MareSync hooked into Penumbra/Glamourer in order to transmit the appearance data of your modded character, transfer the\n        files through a management server hosted by the developer, and send them to another person to be rendered live. This\n        massively changed the modding ecosystem of FFXIV forever and what was joking \"a niche of a niche plugin\" became hundreds\n        of thousands of users over its three-year lifespan. At one point near the end of its lifespan it had transferred\n        Petabytes (PLURAL) of data a month. How Cloudflare didn't freak out about it we'll never know...\n\n        Due to some back and forth with the developer I was tagged as a 'wannabe dev' in their Discord server, which gave me\n        access to see behind the curtain a little. I was already hyper-connected to a lot of info streams but it opened my eyes\n        to a lot about the community as a whole - for better and most definitely for worse. Darkarchon is pretty damn\n        knowledgeable and he held together a lot of the community whether they realized it or not.\n    \u003C/p>\n\u003C/details>\n## Day 0\nWhich made the day he posted he would be shutting down the service a shock to everyone.\n![The shutdown announcement from Darkarchon in the MareSync Discord](MareSyncShutdownAnnouncement.png)\n\nThose of us marked as wannabe devs had some advance knowledge on it, as the process of verifying/consulting with legal\nwas done ahead of any public posts (not that it stopped someone leaking it from a closed dev chat in the Dalamud\ndiscord). I'll probably do an aside about some of the really weird and honestly alarming things I saw come out of\nthe community and Internet at large as a result of this announcement. It was very eye-opening.\n\nNeedless to say the situation sucked for the XIV community at-large. People had gotten used to a level of comfort with\nthese plugins that was always unsustainable. It's all built on hopes and dreams that Square Enix wouldn't flip the\nentirety of Dalamud on its head one day. They still could, to be clear, and even as I type this I see posts about \nprojects doubling down on the very things the director and producer YoshiP took issue with about these plugins. (link)\n\nIn the wake of the shutdown people scrambled to try to replace the functionality. Whole communities were built up around\nsyncing mods for coordinated events (venues, roleplaying, 'nightclubs' or whatever you want to call them). Thus the\nsync wars had begun...\n\n## Day 7\nIt didn't take long for replacements to prop up and tribalism to begin, but I didn't really care to try to integrate\nmyself into any of them. I noticed my wife and her Free Company didn't, either, and it got me thinking...\n\nWhat if I built a private version of the plugin? Darkarchon had made the source code available with some simple\ninstructions on how to do it, so why couldn't I follow them? Surely it's not that hard, right? (The original source\ncode is no longer available but many backups were floating around, including other sync services building on top of it)\n\nSpoiler: it was more difficult than even the devs I followed to a new group like a leech implied it was. For me, at\nleast. I'm not a programmer by any means, but I know how to read and apply code, interpret what I'm seeing and follow\nalong due to my background in scripting and general domain administration. So with a lot of help from a few of them\nand a ton of research along the way I set out to make my own private instance for my wife and her friends.\n\n## Lets get technical\nMare Synchronos is built in .NET upon the existing framework provided by Dalamud. Right out of the box as long as the\nplugin had a server to respond back to queries the plugin itself would work without issue once loaded into XIV.\n\n(Note for later: probably link to or write up a blog about wtf Dalamud et al even is from my PoV as an unskilled\nprogrammer and wannabe developer)\n\n\u003CCallout type=\"warning\">\n    For obvious reasons I am not including screenshots of any of this working in game but I will post code snippets as\n    relevant.\n\u003C/Callout>","src/content/blog/01-maresync-saga/index.mdx","e75bf7572fed254d","02-moving-to-cachyos",{"id":35,"data":37,"body":44,"filePath":45,"digest":46,"deferredRender":20},{"title":38,"description":39,"date":40,"tags":41},"Switching to CachyOS","Ads?
