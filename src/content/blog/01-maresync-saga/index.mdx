<Callout type="info">
  This blog is likely going to explain in way more detail than a lot of the FFXIV community cares for.
    I am sharing this blog with people unfamiliar with Mare Synchronos, Dalamud, or even FFXIV.
    I'm trying to accomodate for a wide audience, so sorry if I over-explain a little!

        The Final Fantasy XIV community is blessed with a large group of people dedicated to enhancing the game outside
        the bounds of what's available out of the box. XIVLauncher (link) comes bundled with Dalamud, a system that hooks
        into game functions on-the-fly to read, act on, enhance, and even completely replace elements and functionality
        entirely. Simple things like calculating critical hit percent chance from your Crit stat to display on your
        character sheet all the way to outright fully automated gameplay.

        The Dalamud team has a list of prepackaged and reviewed sets of these plugins that meet specific criteria, like
        not sending invalid data to the servers or performing detectable automation. Outside of this realm is where
        Mare Synchronos comes in.

        Custom Repo Plugins don't fall under the review purview of the Dalamud team, so people are free to develop plugins
        however they like to do whatever they want. A subsection of these plugins revolve around modding, or doing
        things like texture and model replacements, enhancing the functionality of the /gpose (screenshot tools) functions,
        etc.. Penumbra/Glamourer, the two cornerstone plugins that handle on-the-fly texture and model editting/swaps, are
        probably the most used plugins in the ecosystem _period_... people just want their catgirls to look pretty.

        However, modding plugins (and most other plugins) by their nature are client side only - if it's not sending any data
        to the server then no one else but you can see them. (Link to the YoshiP blog?) This is where Mare Synchronos comes in.

        MareSync hooked into Penumbra/Glamourer in order to transmit the appearance data of your modded character, transfer the
        files through a management server hosted by the developer, and send them to another person to be rendered live. This
        massively changed the modding ecosystem of FFXIV forever and what was joking "a niche of a niche plugin" became hundreds
        of thousands of users over its three-year lifespan. At one point near the end of its lifespan it had transferred
        Petabytes (PLURAL) of data a month. How Cloudflare didn't freak out about it we'll never know...

        Due to some back and forth with the developer I was tagged as a 'wannabe dev' in their Discord server, which gave me
        access to see behind the curtain a little. I was already hyper-connected to a lot of info streams but it opened my eyes
        to a lot about the community as a whole - for better and most definitely for worse. Darkarchon is pretty damn
        knowledgeable and he held together a lot of the community whether they realized it or not.

## Day 0
Which made the day he informed everyone he would be shutting down the service a shock to literally everyone.

## Day 7
So I started building things...
