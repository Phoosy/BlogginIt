    I'm gonna be really irritated about this one, also this is just mostly a stub to remind me to write more about this

So yeah, apparently you can just straight up break PAM authentication by inserting pam_yubico.so in
/etc/pam.d/system-login above the other flows regardless of what options you set. Imagine my surprise when I pulled up
TTY, typed in my user name, hit enter, and immediately got a shell despite not even having my yubikey plugged in.
